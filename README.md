## What is Big Brothapp?

Big Brothapp is a reality game show whose premise is a group of
contestants living together in a large house, isolated from the
outside world and governed by the Brotha, the eye that sees it
all. Each series lasts for about three months, with 12â€“16
contestants entering the house. To win the final cash prize, a
contestant must survive periodic evictions and be the last one
standing.

At regular intervals, the housemates privately
nominate (providing a cause) a fellow housemate whom they wish
nominee to leave the house. The housemates with the most
nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the
opportunity to vote for whom they wish to see evicted. The Brotha
is responsible for starting the nomination phase of an
eviction. The polling phase starts just after all the housemates
have nominated. Finally, the Brotha determines the end of the
polling process. After the votes are tallied, the evictee leaves
the house. It may worth mentioning that a housemate cannot leave
the house while an eviction process is opened. On the other hand,
the Brotha is empowered to fire a contestant if he behaves
improperly.

At the end of the game, the last remaining housemate is declared
the winner for the particular series and receives the prize.
